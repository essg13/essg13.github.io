                  <p>Introduction to Research</p>
                  <p>Surveys and Questionnaires (focus on questionnaires.)</p>
                  <p>"Get all the information you can, we'll think of a use for it later." - common practice.</p>
                  <p>Pros</p>
                  <p>Popular in quant, can be used for qual also.</p>
                  <p>Enables coverage of large spread of population.</p>
                  <p>Cons</p>
                  <p>Results can be misleading unless done well.</p>
                  <p>Survey is the measurement process. Questionnaire is the highty structured instrument comprising of a set of 'questions'.</p>
                  <p>How to set questions</p>
                  <p>Questions may be in the form of statements, W/H question not necessary.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>According to what we know</p>

                      <p>Well organised - order, grouping and mix of structured and unstructured questions.</p>

                  <p>What people do</p>
                  <p>Attitude</p>
                  <p>A learned, stable predisposition to respond to oneself, others, objects, events and issues in a consistently favourable or unfavourable way.</p>
                  <p>Types of Attitude</p>
                  <p>Cognitive</p>
                  <p>Memories, evaluations, beliefs</p>
                  <p>Affective</p>
                  <p>Feelings, emotions, intuitions, values</p>
                  <p>Behaviourally bases</p>
                  <p>Expectations, behavioural intentions</p>
                  <p>Attitude influences behaviour and vice-versa as well.</p>
                  <p>Developing a survey questionnaire</p>
                  <p>1 Research Question</p>
                  <p>What are things you want to find? What to conclude?</p>

                  <p>Specific, analysable questions participants must answer.</p>

                  <p>Exact form and content of questionnaire.</p>
                  <p>Known x Unknown</p>
                  <p>Known Known - You know you know this.</p>
                  <p>Known Unknown - You know you don't know this.</p>
                  <p>Unknown Known - You don't know you know this - you have some partial information.</p>
                  <p>Unknown Unknown - You don't know anything about this.</p>

                  <p>Random sampling is not always the best sampling method.</p>
