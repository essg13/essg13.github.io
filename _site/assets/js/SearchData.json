I worked with the Jobsplane team on an updated brand identity, a redesign of their website, and on the design for their new mobile app. Identity . The website and branding for Jobsplane had to be modernised without losing the identity users were used to. The challenge was to stick with the same red and grey branding as on the jobsplane.com website, combine it with the material design guidelines to get a cohesive design identity, and apply it across the new website and app. I made the logo sleeker and created a color palette based on the colors used in the logo and website. I also worked on a caped mascot that I used in the brand illustrations. The logo, color scheme, mascot and app icon. Website . The Jobsplane website did not have a landing page — first time users were directly lead to job listings, and if they tried to apply for a job, they would be asked to sign up or sign in. I created a landing page that explained the core ideas behind Jobsplane, and created an onboarding process for first time users. Mobile App . I worked on a design for Android, with an iOS app planned for a later date. Login and Resume upload . After signing in, the user starts filling out their details. If they are already a Jobsplane.com user, their data will be auto-filled from the website database. Preferences, skills and profile. Jobsplane creates a database of jobs, and uses machine learning algorithms to match users to the best possible jobs for them. To help users apply for the right jobs, the UX for the app needed to be radically different from the website. While the website aimed at showing users all of their options and letting them pick the jobs they were most interested in, but this quickly got overwhelming on mobile. The larger screen area on desktops and laptops can be used to show multiple jobs at a time. On a phone-sized screen, however, this leads to an unpleasant, cluttered interface. The solution, then, was to show the user only one job at a time. The app curates the jobs most suitable for the user, and these jobs are then shown sequentially to the user. The user can choose to apply for the job, or ignore it. I tried a few different ways to show a list of jobs, and eventually settled on Tinder-style cards which could be swiped left to reject the job, or right to send an application. Home screen and menu . The problem with this approach was that not all users would be familiar with the swiping gesture. I decided to use the onboarding process as a small training exercise. Instead of the a full-screen onboarding, we used the same swipeable cards as the jobs screen. The first card instructs you to swipe right to begin, and the user learns that cards can be swiped away.",

"content": "While interning at Zomato last winter, I worked on some illustrations for a Zomato iMessage sticker pack. I wanted a hand-made look for the stickers, so I was manually doing the lettering using a Wacom graphics tablet. I really liked how it turned out — and wondered if I could turn it into a font for use in future projects. Graphics from the Sticker pack. I looked up softwares for creating fonts, and came across BirdFont — a free, open source font editor. BirdFont has a lot of weird quirks, but it has some documentation so it wasn’t too hard to play around with it to figure it out. It was great for a beginner like me, but the interface (like many open source software) leaves a lot to be desired. If you are seriously considering getting into type design, I’d recommend looking into other commercial options. The Birdfont interface. The Process . Birdfont supports copy-pasting from Illustrator, so I took my existing vectors from Illustrator and simply pasted them into Birdfont. I tweaked some of the shapes directly in Birdfont to fix scaling/rotation issues — but it’s a lot more complicated to do this in Birdfont (and it took me a while to even figure out how) so I’d recommend getting your shapes as clean as possible within Illustrator. I first worked only on the capital letters, and tested out the resulting font file. It was a lot better than I expected, and so I decided to complete the default unicode glyphs — uppercase, lowercase, numbers and some punctuation as a side project. Here’s what that looked like after a weekend of work: . I remember my early days as a design enthusiast on the internet — the free fonts on Dafont.com never came with any punctuation marks. I made sure to support at least the basics. What I learned . I wish I’d read up a little more about things I needed to keep in mind before I got started, because I created all my letters a lot smaller than I should have. This means the default line height is way too much. It can be fixed by using custom line heights, but it’s still not ideal. Line height can’t be directly changed in Birdfont, and I’d have to individually scale up each character and then fix the kerning to fix the issue. This didn’t seem worth the time, so it’s an open issue for now. Line height issues in Lettuce Party. Download . Lettuce Party is free and open source. If you have any suggestions, you can file an issue on GitHub or write to me at feedback@gyanl.com. You can also check out the BirdFont project on the GitHub repo.

"doc":  "Interning at Zomato",
"title": "Interning at Zomato",
"content": "How did I get here? . I’ve been working as a freelance designer for a while now, and this has been a constant learning experience. In the past three years I’ve done branding work, made print posters and magazines, created illustrations and infographics, designed and coded websites, worked on interface design for mobile apps, and conducted user research, and worked with over 30 startups and businesses. As the sole designer at most places I worked, I was often the only one advocating for the user and pushing for design thinking. I’ve enjoyed the freedom this has afforded me to do things my way, but I’ve also always wanted to work with other designers, and I’d been looking for a chance to work as part of a design team for a while. Say hello to doodle Gyan. In November 2016, I went for a Product Thinking workshop organized by the Zomato design team. After a pretty interesting talk, I talked to the team over pizza, and asked them about the possibility of interning with Zomato in the winter. I sent over my portfolio, interviewed with them a few days later, and started work as an intern on the Product Design team in December 2016. My apologies to the otherwise much nicer looking team at Zomato. What I did . I signed an NDA so I can’t show my work, but I used field research and inputs from Zomato’s Collections and Engineering teams to streamline their data collection process from restaurants, and redesigned their internal data collection app using Zomato’s design system in Sketch. I then created Invision prototypes and conducted usability testing on the redesign. As a second project I also worked on designing an iMessage sticker pack for the Zomato iOS app. What I learnt . 1. Do your research. With a lot of projects, I’ve made design decisions by trying to put myself in the user’s shoes — because I had no actual data to go on. Empathising with the user is important, but it’s not a substitute for actual user research. The first time I went out into the field to conduct research, I was blown away by how many of my assumptions about the users were wrong. I worked with my mentor Ais to map out all the actions a user could perform with the app and created a flow chart to understand the sequence of events. This acted as a helpful reference later. 2. Start on paper. I’d been using Sketch so much for so long that I’d started feeling like it’s faster for me to design directly in Sketch. Sketch definitely is really really quick once you learn it, but sketching on paper first lets you think of the why behind design decisions before jumping into detailing each pixel. Regardless of how efficient your digital flow is, it hurts a lot less to discard bad ideas when they’re just squiggles on paper. If I could go back and do one thing differently, I’d plan out the entire app on paper before I moved to a screen — I’ve wasted a lot of time making changes to pixel perfect screens where I had to move everything else around to accommodate an idea I just had. 3. Validate with users. Testing a clickable prototype of the app with a user. The worst parts of your design can be hard for you to identify — since you made it, everything makes sense to you. User research can be as simple as showing your app or prototype to someone and asking them to enact a given scenario and telling them to speak out loud about what they are thinking as they use it. 4. Write it down. When I started my internship, I noticed that everyone had notebooks in which they wrote down any feedback they got, or any ideas they had. I’ve mostly trusted my brain to remember things (and then utterly forgotten) or used digital notes, but I’ve started maintaining a notebook and it’s been surprisingly useful. My boss Ashish Goel sketch-noted my final presentation to the team. I learned a lot this winter, and had a great time working with Zomato. Shoutout to the design team at Zomato for making me feel welcome and being all-round great to work with. My team got me cake on my last day at work!

"title": "Plutonium Sans",
"content": ". A few months ago, I worked on a script typeface based on my handwriting. I called it Lettuce Party. It was my first foray into type design, and I came out of the experience with a lot of insights into what not to do when you are trying to design a typeface. This summer, I read Never Use Futura and decided to work on my own sans serif inspired by the geometric forms of Futura. This was the result. Plutonium Sans . Type sample . Lowercase letters (bold weight) . Capitals (regular weight) . Getting started . I started Lettuce Party with no previous experience or research into type design, which caused a lot of technical problems later in the process. This time I did my homework, and read about best practices for starting a type design project. This removed a lot of the trial and error of figuring out tools and techniques on my own, and made my workflow a lot more efficient. Glyphs . I had previously used Birdfont, a free &amp;amp; open source font editor, but had found it confusing and badly documented. I was keen to try out other font editors, and settled on Glyphs for Mac. It’s a paid software with a 30 day trial that I used, and their website has some great tutorials to get you started. Glyphs for Mac . I used Illustrator to draw the HOno as control characters to define the look and feel of the typeface. I used Illustrator since that was what I was comfortable with, but I moved to Glyphs soon after and the pen tool quickly grew on me. Before long I had completed a first draft of the lowercase letters. Early version of the lowercase letters from a to t. Making words . I started stringing letters into words to check how they looked together. Certain combinations of letters looked off, and it was helpful to compare characters side by side to see what worked and what didn’t. I tweaked things as I went along, and took screenshots of anything I liked so I could come back to ideas. ‘adhesion’ was one of the early words I used to test the font, and it also became my work in progress name for the font. The early lowercase ‘a’ had a teardrop shape to it which felt a bit odd to me. I later tried a double storey ‘a’, and eventually abandoned for a more traditional geometric form. Double storey ‘a’ in an exploration for an italic weight. Alpine joke . Fjord . Final lowercase glyphs . A few days later I was happy with my lowercase letters, and it was time to work on the uppercase. I followed a similar process of trial and error, creating a few characters and then stringing them together and making any modifications that felt appropriate. I did not want the typeface to look too formal, so I allowed myself to have some fun with some of the letters. I was particularly happy with how the k and y came out. Upper and Lower case letters . Get Plutonium . I spent a lot of time polishing Plutonium and I learnt a lot in the process that I will hopefully use for my next font. While it&#39;s not perfect and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for anything other than as a novelty display font, is at a stage where I feel comfortable sharing with people. Plutonium is free for use for commercial or private projects. You can download the current version here.

Dots is an an experimental installation I worked on with my friend Rashmi in my first semester at IDC School of Design. We wanted to create a fun installation that could grab the attention of someone passing by it, and let people explore what it could do without any explanations. How did we do it? . We started out by trying to use Processing and the input from a video camera to try and allow people to &#39;paint&#39; on a screen by moving their arms in front of it. The camera input turned out to be a slow and inefficient way of detecting gestures, and our instructor for the course suggested we use a Kinect sensor instead. There was thankfully a first generation Kinect available in the IDC office, and a couple of Daniel Schiffman tutorials later, Rashmi and I we were ready to make something. The test setup for running dots. We later used a large wall TV mounted to run the installation. While going through some of these tutorials, I was fascinated with just the raw data the infrared sensor was capturing. I wondered if I could somehow represent this depth data in 2 dimensions, and came up with the idea of mapping depth to color. Objects closer to the sensor could be warm colors, and objects further away could be cool. Rashmi (right) is standing closer to the screen than me (left) and so appears in warmer colors. The result . While we didn&#39;t have enough technical expertise to make exactly what we wanted, we tried to make Dots a multisensory experience by having the dots vibrate in reaction to sound. Your browser does not support the video tag. Celebrating the first time we got the code working! Making loud noises (like the high-five) also causes the dots to vibrate.

I traced the Delhi Ridge forest and the Yamuna river to ground the map in two of the larger natural features of the city, and marked dots for parks, gardens, forests and some of the places of interest that I like and recommend to people. I also marked the larger areas surrounding Delhi, so I could take a call on how much of them to represent or not represent.

"content": "What is OSM? . OpenStreetMap is an open source project that aims to create a free, editable map of the world. It&#39;s like Wikipedia, but for maps. How did we do it? . Most of us followed the instructions to update OSM through the Java based OSM editor JOSM, for which our senior Rohit had a blog article. However, this method is a little complicated, and doesn&#39;t work very well for people with iOS devices, and even for Android requires a series of hoops you have to jump through. A much easier method to contribute to OSM is using the MAPS.ME mobile app. They have an app for both iOS and Android, and I&#39;m detailing the process below. Step 0 . Before starting, review the OSM contribution guidelines. Step 1 . Sign up for an OSM account at openstreetmap.org. Step 2 . Download MAPS.ME for Android or iOS. Step 3 . Open the Settings section in MAPS.ME and go to the OpenStreetMap profile option. Sign in with your OSM credentials. Step 4 . Dont do armchair mapping, and get out into the field. Use the overflow menu to find the &quot;Add place to the map&quot; option. Select the type of amenity, and you can fill out more details about the place like the name or business hours or phone number (depending on the type of amenity). Checking your contributions with Overpass . Go to the Overpass Turbo website and paste in the code below, but replace GauriT with your OSM username. [out:json][timeout:25]; ( node(user:&quot;GauriT&quot;)({{bbox}}); way(user:&quot;GauriT&quot;)({{bbox}}); relation(user:&quot;GauriT&quot;)({{bbox}}); ); out body; &amp;gt;; out skel qt; . On the right pane, navigate to the area you mapped and you should be able to see all your accepted changes. If you can&#39;t see the changes, they might be under review by the OSM community, and you can check in later. Contributions by IxD 2020 . As part of my Data Visualization course at IDC School of Design, my classmates and I went to Galleria and Central Avenue in Hirandandani, Powai, and marked some places on the map. This article documents which places we went to and what we marked. | Contributor | Area | Amenity | Count | . | Avyay | Central Avenue, High Street, and Powai Road | Benches, Dustbins and and Bus Stops | 55 | . | Aishwary | Central Avenue: the Lucky Lane | Everything in the lane (shops, buildings, services) | 48 | . | Prachi | Galleria, Central Avenue | beauty, clothing, services, food | 37 | . | Dhiraj | Powai area opposite to IIT campus | All | 37 | . | Bhawna | Powai area opposite to IIT campus | All | 37 | . | Gauri | Orchard Avenue, Heera Panna Shopping complex | Shops, Restaurants, Gardens, Bus stops | 32 | . | Akshay | area in front of Y point gate | beauty, clothes, convenience, electronics, electronics_repair, jeweller, optician, printer, stationery | 30 | . | Mayura | area in front of Y point gate | beauty, clothes, convenience, electronics, electronics_repair, jeweller, optician, printer, stationery | 30 | . | Aisha | area in front of Y point gate | beauty, clothes, convenience, electronics, electronics_repair, jeweller, optician, printer, stationery | 30 | . | Gyan | Galleria, Central Avenue | beauty, clothes, convenience, electronics, electronics_repair, jeweller, optician, printer, stationery | 27 | . | Rishi | Hiranandani Galleria, Central Avenue | Amenities (Food related), a few shops | 26 | . | Anjan | Central avenue, Galleria, Hiranandani | Restaurants, Eateries, Cafe | 21 | . | Maulashree | Central Avenue, Forest Avenue in Hiranandani and also Vasant Vihar, Siddhachal and Pokharan road number 2 in Thane | Fast food chains, benches, restaurants, cafes, stationery shops, convenience stores, medical stores | x | . | Rashmi | Central Avenue | ATM, fashion, flower shops, pharmacy, spa, cafe and restaurants, wineshop, dustbins | x | . | Shraddha | Central Avenue | ATM, fashion, flower shops, pharmacy, spa, cafe and restaurants, wineshop, dustbins | x | . | Eeshani | Jogeshwari Vikhroli link | Apartment, shops | x | .

There is no difference in the proportion of women in the professions of engineering and design. Research Design . Tension between external v/s internal validity . If you control some of the random variables, variablity comes down. Some degree of randomness allows for better external validity. Between Subjects . Each participant is tested on one condition only. More participants, but shorter study each. Variation in skills of participants can affect the study, needs balancing variables across test conditions. Within Subjects . Each participant is tested on each condition. AKA repeated measures. Fewer participants, but longer study each. Less variation because of skills of participants, balancing not needed. Order effects (eg. learning, practice, fatigue) are possible - counterbalancing reqd. Asymmetric learning effects . Eg. Keyboard A teaches people how to use keyboard B and vice versa.

Popular in quant, can be used for qual also. Enables coverage of large spread of population. Cons . Results can be misleading unless done well. Survey is the measurement process. Questionnaire is the highty structured instrument comprising of a set of &#39;questions&#39;. How to set questions . Questions may be in the form of statements, W/H question not necessary. | According to what we know . | Intangible/invisible things we want to know converted into &#39;questions&#39; . | Well organised - order, grouping and mix of structured and unstructured questions. | Articulated in a manner to reduce biases and errors . | Answers must be analysable . | Appropriate communication approach . | Interview, self-administered . | Paper based, telephonic, web . | . Behaviour and Attitude measurement . Behaviour . What people do . Attitude . A learned, stable predisposition to respond to oneself, others, objects, events and issues in a consistently favourable or unfavourable way. Types of Attitude . Cognitive . Memories, evaluations, beliefs . Affective . Feelings, emotions, intuitions, values . Behaviourally bases . Expectations, behavioural intentions . Attitude influences behaviour and vice-versa as well. Developing a survey questionnaire . 1 Research Question . What are things you want to find? What to conclude? . 2 Investigative Questions . Specific questions that adequately cover research questions? . 3 Measurement questions . Specific, analysable questions participants must answer. 4 Questionnaire development . Exact form and content of questionnaire. Known x Unknown . Known Known - You know you know this. Known Unknown - You know you don&#39;t know this. Unknown Known - You don&#39;t know you know this - you have some partial information. Unknown Unknown - You don&#39;t know anything about this. Friday, 6 September 2019  . Dr. Pramod Khambete .

Creswell (2007) . Be flexible . Expect deviations from the plan, things can and will go wrong. Adapt to the situation. Random sampling is not always the best sampling method. Sampling is usually not random, sample composition may emerge during study. Random sample is not 100% representative sample. Recognise role of gatekeeper . Voluntary participation is a must, but role of gatekeeper can introduce filters in population, or influence people to talk to you or be more guarded. Recording, collecting, storing data . Nuances v/s. Hard data - need to strike a balance . Use multiple methods/tools (eg. notes, audio rec, video rec) . Generally, you won&#39;t be able to interview the same person again. Ethics . Don&#39;t record without consent . Participants must not face any risks, even inadvertently . Interviewer is in position of control, there is power asymmetry. Be conscious of this. Interview . Purposeful conversation - not a Q&amp;amp;A. Needs to be flexible. Your aim is to get information, other person has no obligation to you and is doing you a favor.

Claims and Arguments . &quot;The first part of this talk is a rant. It&#39;s a personal rant, aimed mostly at the Mdes folks, but don&#39;t feel too bad.&quot; . Design exceptionalism . With no prior knowledge about the domain, there is this expectation that you will be able to do better than people in the domain. Eg. go to school, think you know better than someone who has been teaching for 30 years. This leads to the designer as a tourist - expecting others to do things for you, your experience is at the center. Othering . From postmodernism - never become them, but profit from them. Designers claim more than what they do. If you claim you will make a blackboard, as a product designer, that&#39;s okay. If you claim you will radically change education in India, that&#39;s a problem. Informed designers . | Critically aware of own limitations | Use evidence to evaluate, make judgements | Are interested in opposing ideas | Understanding, learning as a goal | Avoid emotionalism, think before acting | Open mind, open to criticism | . Some words . | Fact | Claim | Opinion | Assumptiom | Argument | Inference | Plausible | Validity | Thesis | Evidence | Rationale | Warrant | . Every design is a claim . A claim is a statement that something is true. | people might not believe it | typically designers don&#39;t provide evidence/proof | evaluated as: accept, reject, suspend judgement (not enough proof) | . &quot;Designers are, जैसे Fight Club में कहते हैं, middle children of nowhere. We are not marketing, scientists, but we&#39;d like to be both.&quot; - Girish 2019 . A claim needs Arguments . An arguments os the reason(s) why you support a claim. The process of exmplaining these reasons is argumentation. &quot;If you accept arguments without evidence, others will ask for it. External will ask for it.&quot; - Girish 2019 . Thesis . A thesis is the main idea, opinion or theory. | contains multiple claims | includes evidence | . Greek modes of persuasion . Logos . | Logical appeal/appeal to reason | Use data to support claim | . Ethos . | Appeal to character/appeal to credibility | Use people&#39;s character/trustworthiness to support claim | . &quot;If Narendra Modi says everyone should start designing for AR/VR…&quot; - Girish 2019 . Pathos . | Appeal to emotion/appeal to &quot;values &amp;amp; beliefs&quot; | Use people&#39;s ability toempathize to support claim | . &quot;Education in this country is terrible, think about the children…&quot; - Girish 2019 . Toulmin Model of Argumentation . | Informal method of reasoning | Method for constructing, analyzing arguments | Tool for diagramming arguments | . Types of claims . | Fact: an empirically verifiable phenomena | Judgement/value: opinions, attitudes, subjective evaluation | Policy: advocating courses of action that should be undertaken | Definition/Classification: indicates what criteria are being used to define a term or what category something falls into | . Fallacies . Claims and warrants are prone to fallacies. Loaded question . Question assumes an unjustified/unproved assumptions. | How can teaching be made effective by using iPads? | Are you still beating your wife? | . Appeal to Popularity . AKA Bandwagon effect. Claim that something is good/true because it is popular. | A lot of people want to come to IDC to do Mdes, so it is India&#39;s #1 design school. | A lot of people watch Sallu bhai&#39;s movies, he must be a good actor. | . Hasty Generalization . Claim on the basis of inadequate evidence. | Two out of three VC students I asked don&#39;t want a studio space. | I benefitted from swimming, you should do it too. | . Sweeping Generalization . Absolute statements that involve words such as all, always . | All children are creative | School education destroys children&#39;s creativity | . &quot;Children are, quite sorry to say, quite stupid.&quot; - Girish 2019 . &quot;Creativity is measured by diverse ideas. In the study, they found children can only do one or two घिसा पिटा ideas.&quot; - Girish 2019 . &quot;I did a study, around 80% of Bengalis love fish.&quot; . Post Hoc Fallacy . Claiming cause-effect relationship simply because one event preceded another. (Co-occurence) . | Students are denied studio spaces | Grades of students are poorer than earlier years | Denial of studio spaces caused a drop in grades | . Non sequitur Fallacy . Linking two ideas that have no logical connection . | Girish is a farmer, so he must be depressed. | Roma studied in America, so she must be smart. | . False analogy .

"title": "Making chord diagrams with Circos Online",
"content": "What is Circos? . Circos is a free and open source software package for visualizing data in a circular layout i.e. as chord diagrams. It has been featured in many scientific and other publications (including the covers of both Science and Nature), so it&#39;s safe to say science people really like it. Why Circos? . | It looks pretty. | Circular layouts are great for exploring relationships between objects or positions. | Highly customizable. | High data-to-ink ratio. | .svg or .png output, can be used for print. | Scriptable, can be made part of an automated data pipeline. | Did I mention it looks pretty? | . Circos is ideal for creating publication-quality infographics and illustrations with a high data-to-ink ratio, richly layered data and pleasant symmetries. You have fine control each element in the figure to tailor its focus points and detail to your audience. Use in Genomics . Circos is used extensively for the analysis of genomic alterations over time, or differences between two or more genomes. You can take a look here. How can I use Circos? . From the Circos landing page… . Creation of images is controlled through a plain-text configuration file. There is no interactive user interface. This approach to configuration should be very familiar to you if you have UNIX experience. The emphasis here is mine, but after spending a while trying to understand the complex system of config files you need to setup, I realised that there is also an online version called Circos Online that allows less flexibility and customization options, but can still be used for visualizing simple tables. So let&#39;s use Circos Online! . Now that we know what Circos can do, let&#39;s try and use it! . Pick a dataset. You can pick whatever you like, but I decided to visualize the patterns in key issue and return for the media lab at IDC. I used the last two filled pages of the key register, which looks like this: . Formatting the data . Circos uses : . | A matrix of data | With headers for both rows and coloumns, headers can&#39;t contain spaces | Formatted as a tab separated values (.tsv) file | . Putting tables into Circos . Chances are you have your data in a table, isolate just the two values you&#39;d like to look at the relationship between. In my case, I took just the name of the person issuing the keys, and the name of the person returning the keys. But that poses an issue as Circos can&#39;t technically represent tables. Wait so why are we doing this then? . What Circos can do is represent matrices. What&#39;s the difference? In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers (whereas a table can have any kinds of values). Turning tables into matrices . The matrix takes each pair of (key-in-person, key-out-person) data and inserts +1 into the corresponding position on the matrix. I did this manually, but if you can code, it&#39;s essentially a matter of converting key-value pairs into a matrix . Also remember to put the text &quot;labels&quot; on the top left cell, or Circos Online won&#39;t accept the input. Make sure your headers don&#39;t have any spaces in them, or Circos will fail and throw a bunch of scary looking errors at you. Download a .tsv . In Google Sheets, go to File &amp;gt; Download &amp;gt; Tab-separated values (.tsv, Current sheet) . Upload .tsv to Circos . Upload the .tsv to Circos Online. Leave the checkboxes unchecked for now and click on Visualize Table. The result . It may take a few seconds to load, but once it does, you can pat yourself on the back for a beautiful data visualization. You can now download a large image or a zip with data, images (PNG/SVG) and configuration from Circos online. Let&#39;s look at another example . This data comes from the Data Visualization Community Survey 2019 Challenge. I extracted the education and gender for people who responded to the survey, and got this. | Education | Gender | Count | . | Masters | Man | 353 | . | Bachelors | Man | 291 | . | Masters | Woman | 198 | . | PhD | Man | 143 | . | Bachelors | Woman | 128 | . | PhD | Woman | 72 | . | Technical School | Man | 31 | . | Masters | Prefer not to say | 11 | . | Bachelors | Prefer not to say | 9 | . | PhD | Prefer not to say | 5 | . | Technical School | Woman | 4 | . | Bachelors | Non-binary | 2 | . | Masters | Non-binary | 2 | . | Masters | Woman | 2 | . | Technical School | Non-binary | 1 | . | PhD | Non-binary | 1 | . After (once again, manually) converting to a matrix, we get this matrix. | labels | Man | Woman | NonBinary | PreferNotToSay | . | Bachelors | 291 | 128 | 2 | 9 | . | Masters | 353 | 198 | 2 | 11 | . | PhD | 143 | 71 | 1 | 5 | . | TechnicalSchool | 31 | 4 | 1 | - | .

"content": "With an explosion in high quality open source fonts, there are more options available for designers and novices alike, and the aim was to create an interface that used a more ‘natural’ classification of fonts than the default classification of serif, sans-serif, display, handwritten/script and monospace used by most font sites like Google Fonts. I used a classification created by O&#39;Donovan et al as the basis for my tool. The paper provided ratings from 0-100 for 200 fonts on 37 attributes (like &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;legible&quot;, &quot;attention-grabbing&quot;). I utilised a subset of these fonts available on Google Fonts, and removed some of the parameters to create Font Finder. The results were a bit iffy—not all participants agreed that they were getting the results they hoped for, and some of the attributes (like &quot;artistic&quot;, &quot;fresh&quot;) were confusing because people did not know what an &quot;artistic&quot; or &quot;fresh&quot; font should look like. In retrospect it would have been a better idea to create my own classification by conducting card sorting activities with participants and creating fewer categories that were more meaningful. Things I didn&#39;t address . The experience of browsing indic fonts and variable fonts is still not very smooth, and there is scope for designing a simple way to browse character sets and previewing the full design space of variable fonts. Some interesting examples . Font Collections . Ideo Fontmap Ideo creates a 2 dimensional map of fonts by using dimensionality reduction.

Nobody even cracked a smile when I showed this slide, which tells you just how stressed people were about this course. Photo courtesy of Bhawna . In my third semester at IDC, I was a teaching assistant for the Design Research Methods (DRM) course. Students were expected to have prior knowledge of some statistical concepts, but a lot of students hadn&#39;t studied math or statistics in a few years and found the class hard to follow. I taught a supplementary class that started with an intuitive (I hoped) understanding of some of these basic ideas. Index of terms . Types of Research . | Qualitative | Quantitative | . Types of Research Methods . | Observational - observe and record | Correlational - relationship b/w 2 variables | Experimental - consuct a lab experiment | . Research question . A question about an area of interest. Eg. Is the proportion of women in design higher than in engineering? . Hypothesis . A statement about the relationship between 2 variables. Eg. There is no difference between proportion of women in engineering and design. Experiment Design . An experiment is conducted to find the effect of one variable on another. For eg. | The number of hours of sleep the night before an exam, and the marks scored. | Two different designs of a chair, and the average rating on a scale of 1 to 10 when people were asked to rank comfort. | . Independent variable (or Manipulated variable) . The variable we can control. Eg. hours of sleep, design of chair. Dependent Variable (or Response variable) . The variable that varies because we changed the independent variable. Eg. marks in test, comfort rating . Control Variable . Circumstance not under investigation that is kept constant while testing. Random variable . Circumstance not under investigation that is allowed to vary randomly. Confounding variable . Circumstance not under investigation that has impact on the dependent variable. So we can say that experiment is conducted to find the effect of changing independent variable on dependent variable, but we might get a fake result because of the confounding variable also impacts the dependent variable. Levels of a variable . The number of possible states of a variable are called the levels of the variable. For eg. in our experiment we can have 3, 5, 7, 9 hours of sleep, so hours of sleep variable will have 4 levels. Between subjects . | A is given design 1. They rank it 5/10. | B is given design 2. They rank it 6/10. | . We can say that B is better, but it&#39;s possible that B was just more generous with the rating and would have given design 1 a 6 as well. Within subjects . | Subject A is given design 1. They rank it 5/10. | Subject A is given design 2. They rank it 6/10. | . Order effects within subjects . Design 1 and 2 share some elements. If you learn to use 1, 2 is easier to use. Therefore if you use 1 first or 2 first will impact the ranking. Therefore, we give half of the people design 1 first and the other half design 2 first.",

"content": "“well chosen words deserve well-chosen letters.”- robert bringhurst, the elements of typographic style . This tool allows you to browse fonts to using combinations of adjectives instead of the classification terminology used by graphic designers. Much has been written about how good typography can complement and enhance the mood, style and tone of the text, but for years typography was the domain of specialists who honed the craft over generations of skilled workers. The age of computers lead to a democratisation of type with the technology and capability to produce typography becoming ubiquitous. This has made every layperson who arranges text electronically an unwitting typographer. Designers may spend ages agonising over the most appropriate font for a presentation, report or poster, but these kinds of artefacts are no longer created only by designers trained in typography. Picking fonts is an exercise in decision-making. One must pick a single option out of hundreds, or potentially thousands of fonts. This can be overwhelming—the impossibility of meaningfully picking one out of a seemingly infinite list options means that many stick either with the defaults available to them, or fall back on the heuristic of using popularity to judge quality when the options have no clear differentiating factors making them better than the others. Access to fonts has also increased exponentially. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection has access to font libraries by aggregators like Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts which give users access to thousands of high quality fonts. Many type foundries, such as Hoefler Type, also have subscription plans where their entire catalogue is available for a flat fee. However, the interfaces for accessing these fonts leave much to be desired. Typography is a tool for effective communication, and it should not be limited just to designers due to an artificial entry barrier created by technical jargon and an inability for many to express a need for a font in ways that can be understood by machines.

"content": "Why did I take this elective? . The fourth and last semester of the IDC M.Des. program has a research project and a design project, but no lectures. Masters students at IIT, however, can choose to take one of a set of electives. I thought it would be interesting to make the most of being a design school in IIT Bombay, and take a course offerred by another department. I took the AI, Data and Policy partly because I follow Prof. Guha on Twitter and I happened to see his tweet about the course, and partly because my internship at Microsoft in Summer 2019 involved working with AI, and I felt a little crippled by my inability to actually prototype anything as a designer and wanted to learn more. Initial impressions . I was especially interested in how the course was pitched - over the past year I&#39;ve realised my limitations as a designer being able to create any real impact in social problems without significant policy intervention, and I wanted to see what looking at AI through such a lens could look like. There are two classes a week (Monday and Thursday from 2pm - 3:30pm) and classes alternate between theory classes discussing the socio-political aspect of AI, and coding classes that cover Machine Learning in Python. I thought this was a very interesting approach to the problem, since understanding AI requires both an understanding of the technical aspect and the social, political, ethical and economic impact of AI. Managing courseload (IDC M.Des) . IDC courseload is heavy as it is, and so I checked with my faculty advisor and project guide before taking this course. They said it was a good idea to be exposed to courses outside IDC, but warned me about the courseload and suggested that I could take it as an audit course. DRS and P3 are 12 and 30 credits respectively, and the elective is 6, which adds up to a 48 credit semester. It is possible to take courses as audit courses or as additional learning courses, which do not impact your CPI. I have currently taken the course as an additional learning course. Some thoughts about the first class and this paper . About two years ago, I read a Twitter thread [1] that said the field of Computer Science has not had it’s reckoning yet. It said that unlike Chemistry that had seen dynamite and chemical weapons, and Physics that had seen the atom bomb, the field of Computer Science had not yet had a moment that ‘seared the importance of ethics and consequences’ into the minds of everyone in the field. This has stayed with me as an IT engineer turned into an Interaction Designer. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the first time Google Photos let me search through my photos with words felt like magic, but I also read about the app labelling black people as gorillas [2]. This made me wonder about all the trust we put in what is essentially a black box for decision making. AI systems could be mostly useful, but every now and then spit out wrong or biased results, with no way of understanding why. Data collection and algorithmic curation of everything we do online has become so normalised that the constant surveillance has become implicitly accepted as we use identities controlled by corporations to manage our entire identities online. My summer internship involved working on an AI product, and had to understand and weigh in on issues with data availability to train a model, and issues with model accuracy. As a designer, I felt a little crippled by my limited grasp on the technology and inability to actually prototype anything myself. I read about issues like explaining to the user where smart inputs from an AI agent were coming from, and explaining that the information could be inaccurate sometimes. This motivated me to take this course, and the structure of alternating classes discussing the technical and socio-politico-economic aspects of artificial intelligence was a surprise but in retrospect seems like the obvious approach to be able to completely understand the possible impacts of a piece of AI technology. Vidushi Marda’s paper on AI Policy in India [3] discusses a framework for analysis of social and ethical concerns of ML systems in three stages: data, model and policy. The part of the paper I feel is especially interesting against the wave of protests in India is the use of AI for surveillance and policing by the Indian state. With Delhi Police using an automated facial recognition to find ‘rabble-rousers and miscreants’ [4] at Narendra Modi’s event at Ramlila Maidan, the government has shown how free speech and privacy could be at risk for dissenters. This is despite the 2015 striking down of Section 66A of India’s Information Technology Act by the Supreme Court because it was said to have a ‘chilling effect on free speech’. In a 2017 statement, the Indian supreme court also recognised informational privacy as a fundamental right. With practice preceding policy, there is a void on clear policy against the use of AI by the state in a way that violates fundamental freedoms of the citizens. #20 Jan 2020 Monday, 2pm . References .

My username is gyanl, so I will rename the repository to gyanl.github.io | Download the repository as a zip. | Make changes. | Upload changed files, commit. | Your website is now live at yourgithubusername.github.io | . CSS Properties . Font name . The font-family property specifies the font you want to use. p { font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; } . Font Stack . If the first font in the stack is not available, the second one is used and so on. It is good practice to specify &#39;serif&#39; or &#39;sans-serif&#39; as a fallback in case your custom font doesn&#39;t load. body { font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; } . Font weight . The weight of the font you want to use. Typical nomenclature is: . | 100 Thin | 200 Extra Light | 300 Light | 400 Normal | 500 Medium | 600 Semi Bold | 700 Bold | 800 Extra Bold | 900 Ultra Bold | . If the font family doesn&#39;t provide the requested weight, it will use the closest available one. p { font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; font-weight: 800; } . Font size . The size of the font you want to use. p { font-family: &quot;Roboto Condensed&quot;; font-size: 12px; } . Text alignment . Left, center, right or justify alignment.center{ text-align: center; } .left{ text-align: left; } .right{ text-align: right; } .justify{ text-align: justify; } . Text indentation . The text-indent property indents the first line of a text block. p { text-indent: 50px; } . Tracking . The letter-spacing property controls the tracking between characters. It is convenient to use em as em is dependent on the current text size. p { letter-spacing: 0.1em; } . Leading . The line-height property can be used to control the leading of the text. It is convenient to use em as em is dependent on the current text size. p { line-height: 1.5em; //1.5 em is 150% of text size. } . Text Decoration . Add an underline, overline or strikethrough to text. You can specify the type and color of the line. p { text-decoration: underline; text-decoration: underline overline wavy red; } . Text Transform . Capitalise first word, convert to upper or lowecase. p { text-transform: capitalise; text-transform: uppercase; text-transform: lowercase; } . Color . The color of the text in the block. p { color: #ff4343; } . Background color . The background color of the block. p { background-color: #ff4343; } . Pseudo classes . :hover . Add this to a class and these rules will be activated only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the class. p:hover { background-color: #ff4343; } . :first-letter . Affects only the first letter of the div. p::first-letter { font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; } . :first-line . Affects only the first line of the div. p::first-line { font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; } . Links . Links can be styled using the following properties . a:link { color: #666666; text-decoration: none; } a:visited { color: #333333; } a:hover { text-decoration: underline; } a:active { color: #000000; } .",

"doc":  "Reflections on DRS",
"title": "Reflections on DRS",
"content": "As I look back on my time at IDC I think that I have changed quite a bit in my outlook towards design. As a 22 year old engineering graduate I had discovered an interest in design, had learned the software tools and even found paid projects. I had proven to anxious parents that this was a viable career option, and had a job offer in hand. And yet I felt that I did not know enough to be doing this professionally, and I applied to design schools in the hope that I would be able to fill the gaps in my knowledge. I did not have any intention of becoming a researcher when I applied to the M.Des. program. I didn&#39;t really know much about how academic research works, and I had never read a research paper in its entirety. I had thought that I would learn design theory, and while there was enough of that, I think the really important things I learned were asking questions, challenging assumptions, and how to read, conduct and write about research work. The research methods course in the third semester introduces M.Des. students to the concept of academic research and provides a number of quantitative research methods as methods of analysis. Students learn about structuring arguments and conducting statistically valid experiments. The Design Research Seminar which follows in the fourth semester is a research project in which students are expected to utilise the theory covered in the Research Methods course to identify research questions, design a study, conduct the study, analyse the collected data, and write it up as a research paper. Finding a topic . After years of adapting to an education system that largely tells you what to do, or pick out of a set of limited options, it is strangely paralysing to be asked to choose what you want to work on for the latter half of your time at IDC. You are no longer on the well trodden path of things known to man—instead, you embark on a journey to do something new, something that has never been done before. It&#39;s hard. I had spent much of my third semester struggling to design a “Novel Font Search and Browse tool”. I didn&#39;t have too much to show for it at the end of the project, and I thought it would be best to try something different. I felt I hadn&#39;t done enough research (both primary and secondary) and I had spent a lot of time struggling to build out things in code, out of a belief that a search tool for fonts couldn&#39;t really be prototyped on paper. I wanted to be smarter about picking a good topic for my final semester, and I thought it would be a good idea to use my DRS paper to inform my P3 design project. Finding a “good” topic . I had found it difficult to argue that my project was solving any significant problems. I was convinced myself that picking fonts online could be made simpler, but I was also quite aware of the fact that 12 out of my 16 peers had picked projects in the domains of education, healthcare, accessibility or agriculture. Student design projects are expected to be self-contained solutions to a problem, and students rarely have the expertise or time to really make a dent in the world. However, the kind of projects that seem to be considered “good projects” at IDC tend to be those that attempt to solve challenging social problems. This was a bit of an internal conflict for me—I did not want to pick a topic unless I personally found it interesting, and these areas just didn&#39;t appeal to me. I eventually found a happy medium in misinformation, which seemed to be a real problem that I thought could be studied through the lens of interaction design. Challenges . Human communication is not perfect, and intentional or unintentional misinformation has existed for as long as humans have been talking to each other. The issue, as many authors have pointed out, is that the Internet has given everyone easy access to platforms with a wide reach, and content from sources with journalistic integrity and rigorous fact checking looks the same as crackpot conspiracy theories on social media feeds. It is very easy to believe fake news, and the scale and speed at which this information spreads is exponentially faster than traditional media. Fake news can be seen as a multi-dimensional problem and can be looked at from the lens of journalism, policy-making, technology, and design. However, by casting my net wide, it becomes extremely difficult to isolate the design challenges and opportunities from the other issues such as defining the ‘Truth’ in any practically useful way, trying to decide if satire should be considered as fake news, technology problems like access to WhatsApp APIs, etc. Most approaches discussed in the literature seemed to have a limited impact, and even a highly cited paper in Nature only claimed a small improvement in people&#39;s ability to detect fake news. I decided to narrow down my scope to Misinformation on WhatsApp, and study whether people can recognise misinformation, and their sharing behaviour for items identified as false, true or unknown. Designing the study . I wanted to explore qualitative methods, and I decided to use thematic analysis before I had decided my research questions. This later made it hard to justify why I was using thematic analysis—I hadn&#39;t really explored too many other options and didn&#39;t really try to do the necessary literature review of other possible methods of analysis of the type of data I was collecting. While looking at some of the CHI 2019 papers I later found some other methods that I could have adapted to my study, and in general I will try and do some reading about qualitative methods that I can use going forward. Conducting interviews . I had been a little nervous about conducting user research for my project. The IIT Bombay campus is a safe cocoon that I had felt comfortable in, but the 18-24 year old, educated, tech-literate students I would typically find on campus would be the best equipped to detect fake news. In previous courses I had always worked in groups that contained Marathi speakers who inevitably started talking to users in Marathi, which seemed to immediately put participants at ease. I thought I would find it hard to get people from lower income, lower-education groups to talk to me about messages on their phone unless I could make them feel comfortable around me. I couldn&#39;t speak Marathi, and so I planned ahead and practiced a short script to explain to people that I was a college student at IIT who wanted a few minutes of their time to talk about messages on WhatsApp. If they seemed interested, I explained the study and asked if they were okay with me audio recording our conversation, and explained that I wouldn&#39;t use their name and this was only so I could go over this later. I also dressed to look the part of an IIT student (complete with a bag), and changed my study design to not require users to share any personal information. Without any sort of external organisation to help with recruiting users, or really even a very clearly defined target audience, I eventually just steeled myself to go to the local station and recruit anyone who would be willing to talk to me. It turned out to not be as difficult as I had imagined. Some people were suspicious and did not want to talk to me, or were not comfortable with me recording our conversation, in which case I just thanked them for their time and moved on without any further attempts to convince them. A lot of people, however, were happy to talk, and some even skipped a few trains to talk to me for a longer time. Analysis . It took me about a week just to transcribe my recordings. I had not anticipated it would take this much time, or be this boring. Eventually I got it done, and then spent some time trying to highlight interesting sections in Google docs to get started on finding themes. This was very slow, and I eventually shifted to printouts with large margins so I could highlight sections and add annotations. Highlighting sections on printouts . I was also taking notes on loose sheets, and sometimes on the margins of my printouts, and adding to a Google doc as I was writing my paper in parallel. At one point my room had papers strewn all over it because it was getting so hard to keep track of multiple trains of thought at once. Simultaneously using 3 different sources for information processing: a recipe for disaster . It made me appreciate the process of iteratively building themes using post-its/cutouts in contextual inquiry, and also how helpful it was to have other people to bounce ideas with. I might explore other ways of keeping track of multiple ideas across a text if I do a similar style of analysis in the future, because my process was quite messy and made it very hard to collate information in one place. Writing a paper . I didn’t have very clear research questions before going into the field. My focus was on talking to people, and getting an understanding of how people react to forwarded messages and what drives sharing behavior. My findings largely confirmed existing suspicions—people find it hard to distinguish misinformation merely by reading it, most people don’t bother with fact checking, and just ignore a large section of the messages they get every day. It became difficult to derive any insights that were very interesting for design interventions. I hence relied on the literature review and gut instinct to come up with solutions that I myself was not very convinced would work. This was probably apparent to reviewers, who pointed out that the discussion seemed disjointed from the analysis, and there was not too much new to be gained from reading the paper. I don’t know if I will write more research papers, but I think the learnings from trying to express my thoughts in a coherent manner were helpful in general. I still need to work on improving how I structure arguments in a logical manner. I have been trying to write about my work on my blog, and hope to spend some of my time after graduating on writing about some of my projects, both to document what I have done in my time at IDC and to try and improve how I verbalise the thought process behind these projects.

I then returned to Microsoft after finishing my degree, and started my first job as a UX Designer. I joined the Canvas Voice team in Noida, which worked on experiences like Dictation, Transcription, Read Aloud and Voice Search across Microsoft apps like Word, Outlook and OneNote. Voice @ Microsoft . Projects at Microsoft . Rethinking Read Aloud for mobile . Read Aloud is a text to speech feature in Microsoft Word. It was first introduced on Desktop, where it is frequently used to proof-read documents for tone and typos. Word on mobile devices is used more for consuming documents, and our hypothesis was that Read Aloud would be used differently on mobile devices. I conducted user studies to find out more about how mobile users consume information with voice, and proposed mobile-specific design improvements for Read Aloud. Presenter Coach for PowerPoint Mobile . Presenter Coach helps users rehearse their presentations with AI-powered live feedback. Things like using too many filler words, repeating phrases and reading off the slides are immediately, and a detailed report is generated at the end of the session. The limited space on mobile devices limited what could be shown to users during a rehearsal, and I prototyped a number of possible visual treatments and tested with users to find what users found most helpful. Dictation for OneNote mobile . OneNote on mobile devices has a sticky notes for quickly capturing information, as well as fully fledged OneNote notebooks. I conducted user studies to find out how people use voice technologies to capture thoughts - from using recorded memos as reminders, to students recording lectures to review later. I worked with the OneNote team to introduce voice as a new input method for both sticky notes and Onenote notebooks. Transcription in Microsoft Word . Transcription converts audio recordings into a text transcript, with timestamped sections separated by speaker. Snippets from the transcript can then be used in the Word document. I was responsible for using user feedback to improve support for multiple recordings, adding dark mode support, and extending the feature to Windows. Mobile refresh for Word, Excel &amp;amp; PowerPoint . You can do a lot with the Office suite of apps, and for years the apps have used the Ribbon menu on desktop to organise all the commands. When the WXP Apps were first launched on mobile, they borrowed the structure of the Ribbon to maintain familiarity, with adaptations to the still-new paradigms of mobile apps. I was part of a team that rethought the aging mobile interface, and created new unified design patterns for commanding and navigation across Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

"title": "Freelancing",
"content": "I worked as a freelance graphic and UI/UX designer for many years before switching to a full-time position at Microsoft. Freelancing can be challenging to get started with—and it&#39;s not for everyone, but the freedom to pick your projects, working hours, location and working style can be appealing reasons to try it. Before starting . Creating a portfolio and getting ready to accept projects . Show your work . Create a place to show your work. This could be a portfolio on a site like Behance, Vimeo, Medium, or your own website. Putting your work out is more important than having it in any particular format. I maintain a list of [[Portfolio Sites]] that I like. If you are actively looking for jobs, also keep an updated copy of your resume on your website. Here are some tips for making a great resume. Get a work website and an email . “Looking” professional can help a potential client to trust you with their project. Once you buy a domain, setting up a custom email can be done for free using tools like Zoho. Your website can also feature reviews from clients. Estimate your available time . If you aren&#39;t freelancing full time, make sure you actually have the time to work on the projects you are taking up. Account for time spent studying, finding new projects, managing finances, personal chores, entertainment, etc. Getting projects . I built up a steady flow of projects by constantly reaching out to new potential clients, and These are two things that worked for finding new clients. Cold messaging . Follow people and join communities of people who create things. This could be online on Twitter/Instagram/Discord/Facebook or offline at meetups/events. When you see someone talking about a project that sounds interesting, show them your portfolio and ask if you could help them with their project. Some people will not be interested, but others might show interest and some of those will lead to projects. Offer a freebie . This is more time intensive but also tends to get more responses. When you see someone posting about their product, do a quick critique and show them what a better way to handle it could be. Make sure to be polite about this—not everyone is happy about a random person pointing out problems with something this made. If you feel they are appreciative, offer to help them further improve their product as a paid project. Referrals . If you deliver great value to clients, they will often refer you to other people they knew. Stick to timelines, be communicative about delays or other problems, and mention that you are open to more work when you are closing the project. &quot;The Deal&quot; . What are you going to do, and for how much money? . First conversation . When you first talk to a client, do your best to understand the scope of the project and the exact deliverables. You can check if there is a budget in mind, but do not immediately quote a number. Say you will follow up with an estimate. Follow up . Write down the scope of work, how much time you estimate it will take you to do it, and the expected payment schedule for each deliverable. I have a template for this here. Share this with the client over email—this gives them some context into where the money will go, and also makes sure you are both on the same page about what you will deliver. Insist on an advance . Ask for 10-25% of the project cost up front as an advance. Do not start any work on the project till the advance is in your bank account. If a client is unwilling to pay a token amount to get the work started, they will likely not be willing to pay you the full amount once you deliver the work. I have learnt this the hard way. Estimating for unclear scope . When giving an estimate for a project with an unclear scope, give an estimate for the worst case scenario. Let the client know that it&#39;s an estimate and that you will charge them for the time it actually takes, but in no case will it be more than the estimate. For eg. if your hourly rate is $25, and you think a project might take about 10 hours, quote $300-$350 instead of $250. Be honest with your billing, and if it took less time, your client will feel like they got a good deal. If it actually does take longer (which it often does, things can always go wrong or just be more complicated than expected) you will have a little bit of breathing room in your estimate. Underpromise, Over-deliver . Give the client just a little bit more than you promised them. If you charged for a logo, throw in some business cards. If you&#39;re designing an app for a new startup, create some social media banners for them. Figure out what your client could use, and if it doesn&#39;t take too much effort, do it. This is also a good way to get referred to new clients-people tend to remember and appreciate things like this. Track your time . Use a time-tracking app like Toggl to track how much time you spend on projects. This helps you get better at estimating how much time tasks actually take you, and where your time is going. Once you have a few projects . Freelancing in the long term . Plan for stretches of no work . Unlike a job where there is usually a consistent flow of work and a consistent income, freelance work can come in ebbs and flows. You can sometimes get a lot of work together, and at other times it can feel like there&#39;s nothing for a long stretch. You need to build up savings. Plan for too much work . The flip side of not having work is having too much work. There are only so many hours in the day, and if you take on too much work at once, you may be unable to deliver work on time. I&#39;ve kept in touch with a network of people who do similiar work, and instead of taking on too much work and then being unable to deliver, I sometimes brought on friends to help. Pay your friends generously for their help and they will be happy to help out—but be wary of relying on them too much when there are tight deadlines or critical work. Business relationships going sour can break friendships. Set some boundaries . When you are your own boss, you set your own work hours. Don&#39;t like getting up early? No problem, work at night! Feel like taking a day off when there&#39;s not much to do? That&#39;s fine too. However, the flip side is that when you have no clearly defined time off, you are always &quot;working&quot;, and the work can start to take over your entire life. At the peak of my time doing freelance work, I had a few different clients spread across India, Baku, UK and USA, which meant I was often up at odd hours for calls and I would carry my laptop nearly everywhere I went in case I had work. Keeping clients happy can mean that I would not say no for urgent requests that came through even outside of my usual work hours. This will cause burnout over time. Keep learning . If you get very good at one thing, it&#39;s easy to keep doing the same thing because you understand it better and get faster at it. However, it is also very easy to stagnate in such a situation. It is crucial to keep trying new things and keep yourself from stagnating. Challenge yourself to try new things in your work, or set aside time for learning.",

"title": "CEED Exam &amp; IDC Interview",
"content": ". The IDC logo at the main entrance of the building. I studied Interaction Design at IDC School of Design from 2018-2020, and I have had a number of people reach out to me to ask about the CEED exam and the interview process at IDC. There is not much information available about the exam and interview process online, and so I am collecting some tips here. Preparing for the Exam . Pick a discipline . There are 5 M.Des. programs offered at IDC: . | Animation | Communication Design (Sometimes also called Visual Communication) | Interaction Design | Industrial Design (Sometimes also called Product Design) | Mobility &amp;amp; Vehicle Design | . You can apply for as many as you want, but it&#39;s a good idea to try and find out in advance what each course is like by looking through the course contents on the IDC website. You should prioritise applying and preparing for the course that best aligns with your interests. Go through previous year papers . The CEED website will have an archive of old question papers. While there is no &quot;syllabus&quot; that is provided, you can reverse engineer the sort of things they ask by looking through the papers and finding common patterns. Start going through the papers beginning from the most recent years, and note down the topics the questions touch upon. If you don&#39;t know the answer to a question, read about it and related topics online. If you are stuck you may be able to find solved papers on the Stuff you look blog (I was told about this blog by someone who was preparing for CEED, I&#39;m not sure about the quality of solved papers). Practice drawing . I&#39;m not great at sketching, so this was one of the areas I had to work on. For the interaction design program, your drawing is not expected to be great—just good enough to get an idea across. Nevertheless, you should be able to quickly sketch a person in an environment performing an activity. There are a lot of figure sketching and perspective drawing tutorials on Youtube that can help with this. Preparing for the Interview . Create a Portfolio . Your portfolio showcases your previous work, which can be personal projects, freelance work, or anything else that can show that you have an interest or aptitude for design. For interaction design, this portfolio can be entirely digital (and if interviews are online due to COVID-19 restrictions like in 2020, they will necessarily need to be digital). You can upload projects on Behance or your own website. Focus on writing about all your projects and documenting your process well. Try and tell a story about how you identified a problem and how you went about finding a solution for it. You should be able to justify every decision you made in your work, ideally with some kind of user research/testing or with research/theory from other sources. Go through research work conducted by the faculty . As the M.Des. program is a master&#39;s level course, you will be expected to not only learn things but also contribute to the existing pool of knowledge in the world. Being familiar with the work the faculty have done will show them that you tried to engage with the research projects at IDC when you talk to them at the interview, and should also give you a sense of the kind of work that gets done at the institute. You can find a list of all faculty in IDC and links to their personal pages here. The IDC website might give you outdated or partial information about their work, so you can also search for their work on Google Scholar or other sources. The current faculty in the interaction design department (as of 2020) are: . | Anirudha Joshi | Girish Dalvi | Jayesh Pillai | Pramod Khambete | Ravi Poovaiah | Swati Pal | Venkatesh Rajamanickam | Vivek Kant | .",

These are useful when you want to separate two elements but want to keep them in the same line. Twitter uses an interpunct between the username and date. Icon packs . Using an icon pack saves a lot of time, and even defines the look and feel of your app to an extent. Google&#39;s Material Design icons and Apple&#39;s SF Icons are the default for Android and iOS respectively. Other icon packs you can look at include Feather, Phosphor and Font Awesome. Brand Icons . Brand icons are one of those things you might need over and over, and it&#39;s annoying to keep searching for “Facebook logo png”. A neat hack is installing the Font Awesome 5 fonts. These include the FontAwesome Brands font, and once you install it all you need to do is type in &quot;facebook&quot; into a textbox, and set the font to Font Awesome 5 Brands and the text will turn into the Facebook logo. You can find a list of all supported brand icons here. Units . How do you decide what size to design at? . Print resolutions . For print documents, the concept of PPI refers to pixels per inch, or how many pixels you have in each physical inch. Screen resolutions . For screen documents, the concept of DPI refers to dots per inch, or how many pixels you have in each physical inch. Aspect Ratios . Up until the iPhone X, pretty much all phones had a 16:9 aspect ratio. Android phones usually had 720x1280 (HD) or 1080x1920 (Full HD) displays, and the iPhone 6/7/8 had a 750x1334 display. Things are now a bit more complicated - Android phones can be 18:9 or even 21:9, meaning that there&#39;s no single frame size that accurately depicts most phones. Resizing frames without scaling content . Hold down Command (on Mac) or Control (on Windows) to resize a frame and ignore scaling or constraints set for any child elements. How do you manage this then? . Designers that have studied and internalised grid systems may find it a little hard to adjust to digital systems where the canvas is always changing, and the size of elements is always changing as well. My approach is to just give in to the chaos—it&#39;s not possible to control everything with the level of granularity you can have when designing a print document or a PDF.",

Establish your goals . | Identify your life goals so that you can plan towards those goals. | Calculate what you need to achieve the goal. - if you want to do something 20 years from now, calculate assuming 10% inflation every year for India. | Determine your risk tolerance - you need to have the stomach to see your portfolio go down 30% and not panic sell. | . Make investments . | Allocate resources to each goal | Choose instruments aligning with risk appetite | Invest regularly and systematically | . Monitor and maintain your portfolio . | Establish benchmarks | Compare performance to expectations | Be vigilant, update expectations/strategies | . Ask why someone is giving you financial advice . If a life insurance agent is offering advice, their motivation is usually their commission. Taking advice from a financial advisor who gets a flat fee is probably better. LIC is not a great investment . LIC combines life insurance and investment. You do need life insurace and you should invest money, but you should keep both of those things separate. | Insurance Plan | Sum assured | Annual premium | . | HDFC term life (online) | 50 lakh assured | Premium 5,000 | . | LIC Jeevan Anand | 50 lakh assured | Premium 24,000 | . LIC takes the surplus premium and invests somewhere, but the rate of returns is pretty terrible compared to other financial instruments. Real Estate . First home? Yes, usually a good idea if you&#39;re staying in the same place for at least 5 years. 7-10 ideal. Usually long term appreciation for property is 10-15%. Maybe short term you might get lucky and double or triple, but this is rare. | Home price | Sold in 7 years for | EMI cost | Gain/Loss | Recurring Deposit | . | 40 lakh | 80 lakh | 35 lakh | 45 lakh | 47 lakh | . | 40 lakh | 1.2 crore | 35 lakh | 85 lakh | 47 lakh | . Second home? No, probably a bad idea. Recurring deposit usually makes you more money. Gold . 30 year return is 10-11%, Equity is 15%. Having maybe 5-10% of total assets in gold is okay. In India this tends to be much higher as a lot of people like gold. Safety from government. Stocks . If you have a full time job, you won&#39;t have the time or knowledge to manage a stock portfolio as well as professional brokers in Dalal street. It&#39;s smarter to buy a managed basket of stocks using mutual funds. Make a will . Write it and give it to trusted person. Better to get it written up by lawyer and get it registered (2k-5k cost) . Mutual funds . Check valueresearchonline.com/funds. Equity . Equity = stocks. Equity tends to beat every other asset class long term (even if you started right before something like the 2008 stock market crash). Last 10 year average returns: 16-17%. Next 10 maybe 12% as returns have fallen. | Large cap | Mid cap | Small cap | . | Least volatile | Moderately volative | Most volatile | . Indian companies are not very well regulated, so small cap is risky. Mid to large cap is a better bet. Thumb rule: (100 - your age)% in Equity, rest in debt. Debt . Low volatility, expected returns are 7-9%. As you get older, move your assets from equity to debt so you have less volatility - a market crash can be a larger issue for you when you are older. SIPs . SIPs ensure that you beat market fluctuation and is a more sensible investment methodology than trying to time the market. &quot;Time in the market is better than timing the market.&quot; You can&#39;t time the market, don&#39;t try. Direct v/s. Regular . Broker takes a cut in Regular mutual funds. Broker takes ~1% out of 1.25-3% expense ratio in the mutual fund. Direct funds don&#39;t have the broker cut and expense ratio is lower. Growth v/s. Dividend . Growth mutual funds reinvest your earnings back into the fund. Dividends pay out earnings to your bank account. Dividentds are taxed at a higher rate than capital gains, so unless you are relying on the income growth is preferable. Company stock options . Some companies will give stocks as part of compensation. If you are holding these, you&#39;re betting that your company&#39;s stock will do better than any other type of investment. Safer idea is to sell and put money into mutual funds. You get an indexation benefit (better tax rate) if you hold foreign stocks for 3 years, so hold for at least that long. RSU . Restricted Stock Unit . | Part of company compensation | Granted on joining and/or every rewards cycle based on performance | Vests over 5 years | . ESPP . Employee Stock Purchase Plan . | Option to purchase company stock | At Microsoft, you can use up to 15% of your salary each month to buy MS Stock at 10% less than market rate. You should do this, it&#39;s a no-brainer. | . Mutual Fund Recommendations . From Binu Raj . Multicap . | Franklin India focused Equity fund - multicap | Motilal oswal multicap 35 fund - multicap | PPFAS Long term equity fund - multicap w/30% global equity | PPFAS Flexicap | .

US/Global equity (to protect against Rupee depreciation) . | ICICI Pru US bluechip - US largecaps | Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 - US stocks | . Government savings schemes . Public Provident Fund (PPF) . The PPF is a savings-cum-tax savings investment vehicle that enables one to build a retirement corpus while also saving on annual taxes. You can put up to 1.5 lakh into your PPF account every year (lump-sum or monthly), and that amount is deducted from your taxable income. The Finance Ministry sets the interest rate every year. The interest rate for the quarter 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021 was 7.1% p.a. Employee Provident Fund (EPF) . The Employees&#39; Provident Fund (EPF) is a savings tool for the workforce. 12% of every employee&#39;s basic salary + dearness allowance is invested directly into their EPF account, and an equal amount is contributed by the employer. The interest rate for 2020-21 was 8.5% p.a. The money can be withdrawn at retirement, if you are unemployed for over two months or certain other conditions. Taxation . The employer contribution is exempt from tax, while an employee’s contribution is taxable but eligible for deduction under Section 80C of Income tax Act. The money which you initially invest in EPF, the interest you earn, and the money you withdraw after (as long as it&#39;s after 5 years) are all exempt from income tax. UAN Number . Universal account number (UAN) is a unique 12 digit number for your EPF account. Stays the same even if you change jobs. PF Number . A new PF account number is generated every time an employee joins a new organisation. It is recommended to transfer your EPF account when you join a new company (but you can also choose to withdraw the money). Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) . An employee is allowed to contribute more than the mandatory 12% towards PF in the VPF, but this amount is not matched by the employer and is not exempt from tax. Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) . Out of the 12%, some part goes into the pension scheme, which can be withdrawn after the age of 50 (early retirement) or 58 (regular retirement) as a montly pension.",

"title": "Hindsight in 2020",
"content": "January 2020 started with news articles about massive bush fires that had been raging in Australia. I remember looking at photos and the word &#39;apocalyptic&#39; came to mind. If you&#39;re the sort of person who believes in omens, this looked like one. Things mostly just went downhill from there. We had protests about the CAA/NRC at the beginning of the year, a pandemic in March, locust attacks in June, riots in the US, and the word unprecedented being thrown around all the time. Still, we got through the year, vaccines were developed, people persevered, and we&#39;re now in 2021 where I&#39;m really, really hoping things will start getting better. Things that happened in 2020 . Starting the year . I started my final semester in January trying to pick a final semester project, and preparing myself for the end of my two years at IDC. I had learned a lot, made some great friends, and learned about 12 different answers to the question “What is design?”. It was a bittersweet time, and I was preparing myself for a series of lasts. The last group project. The last all nighter in the Interaction Design studio. The last midnight walk on campus. We were living in the good old days. My friends Rishi and Niharika in my hostel room in better times. Moving back to Delhi . The IIT Bombay campus was shut down in mid-March and I came back to Delhi with just some clothes and my laptop, expecting that campus would reopen in a few weeks. It didn&#39;t, and I got my life&#39;s belongings shipped to me in a cardboard box a few months later. I had been away from home for a year and a half, and it took some time to get used to living at home again. However, I&#39;ve been grateful to have my family around me this year. Graduating from college (remotely) . I graduated from the Interaction Design program at IDC School of Design in June. My final semester project was a concept for crowdsourced reporting and factchecking tool for misinformation on social media (especially WhatsApp) after looking at just how much fake news and propaganda was spreading through the internet about CAA/NRC, COVID-19 and other issues. My classmates and I watched ourselves graduate on a Youtube stream. Starting a new job . I started a job as a UX Designer at Microsoft working on Voice experiences for mobile devices. After a couple years of doing freelance projects from my bedroom, I figured it was time to get a job and so I am now joining Microsoft as a UX Designer (from my bedroom). pic.twitter.com/nDAXwgLcq7 . &amp;mdash; Gyan | ज्ञान (@gyanl) July 13, 2020 It has been an interesting experience to design for voice—patterns for visual design in apps are quite well defined, but voice interactions are newer, and user expectations are more amorphous. So far I have worked on Read Aloud, a text-to-speech feature for Word and transcription in Office. Whiteboard.fm Podcast feature . I was featured on the Whiteboard.fm podcast, talking about starting out in design as a engineering student, finding freelance projects, studying design at IDC and more. Things I hope to do in 2021 . “Things rarely ever go according to plan. You should make a plan anyway.” . I spent most of 2020 feeling like the future was entirely out of control, and I didn&#39;t try to be very ambitious with my plans for the year—choosing instead to do what was most urgent and taking things one day at a time. It seemed like the only sane way to deal with all the uncertainity. However, as we go into a new year in the new normal, I want to take stock of my priorities and be more mindful about what I want to focus on. Get out more . I was extremely cautious about meeting people during the pandemic, erring on the side of caution and avoiding all non-essential activities as COVID cases in Delhi kept rising. I felt that I should do my part by being staying at home as someone in the priviliged position of having a job where working from home was feasible. Things seem to be getting better now, and I want to get over the paranoia I have developed about stepping out of my house (at least for lower risk activities like taking walks). Less screen time . Working from home during the pandemic lead to a level of screen fatigue that I had not experienced before. I set up a desk with a monitor at eye level at the proper distance which helped a little, but I did most of my work online, including user interviews, brainstorming sessions, presentations and meetings which might have otherwise happened in person. I was also doing occasional video calls with friends, attending Zoom conferences, and playing a lot of Valorant. It helped pass the time, but it put a strain on my eyes and I want to try and do things that don&#39;t require staring at screens as much. Mentorship . When I finished school, I found myself quite lost about what I wanted to do with my life, and studied IT Engineering for 4 years because I had to do something. Discovering UI/UX design and teaching myself about it through the internet was a long and meandering process, and I was helped tremendously by people who offered advice and pointed me in the right direction along the way. After going to IDC, I&#39;ve had a number of people reach out to me with questions about getting into design, finding freelance work, internships and jobs, applying to design schools and feedback on projects. I try my best to answer every email and message I get, and while I still feel relatively new in the field, I try my best to share what I do know with anyone who asks and use this website to document my answers for some of the most common questions. Teaching . I realised at my time at IDC that I really like teaching people—as a teaching assistant I taught sessions about web design, typography and research methods. I&#39;m not entirely sure how I want to act on this yet, but maybe this is something I will pursue some years down the line. Read and Write . I did a lot of academic reading and writing in college, and I have tried since to start reading for pleasure again. I have had some moderate success in this regard (thanks in part to the No.1 Book Club of IDC) and I want to use all the books I bought recently for something other than propping up my monitor. I have also tried to write about my experiences and questions that people ask me about design on this blog, and I want to continue the seemingly endless task of properly documenting all of my projects. Move out . I had lived in Delhi all my life before I moved to Bombay for college, so I had never really viewed the extreme temperatures and pollution in Delhi as anything more than an unavoidable inconvenience. Now that I know that moving to another city is an option, I don&#39;t want to be miserable November-January and May-July every year if I can help it. I also want to be able to design my own living and working space, which has been hard while sharing a room with my brother. If all goes well this year (fingers crossed for no alien invasions), I want to move out and live on my own for a while.",

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later. Images . From what I understood, Jekyll doesn&#39;t support source files inside collection folders like _notes. Currently, what I do is, I upload images and attachments manually to /assets/img/ and use . From Assets/Img ![Alt Text](/assets/img/1-how-to.png &quot;Title Here&quot;) . to embed images. This is not effective, but works. Also, public URLs work . From URL ![](https://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png) . From Assets/Img . From URL . Code and Syntax Highlighting . Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn&#39;t. However, many renderers – like Github&#39;s and Markdown Here – support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); . Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it. Inline code has back-ticks around it. Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks – they&#39;re easier and only they support syntax highlighting. ```javascript var s = &quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;; alert(s); ``` ```python s = &quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot; print s ``` ``` No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let&#39;s throw in a tag. ``` . var s = &quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;; alert(s); . s = &quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot; print s . No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let&#39;s throw in a &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;tag&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;. Math expressions . You can write math expressions using the \\LateX\\LateX\\LateX markup language between double dollar signs : $$…$$. They can be written inline or as a single block. For example, . | $$P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$ will render as : | . P(A∣B)=P(B∣A)⋅P(A)P(B)P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}P(A∣B)=P(B)P(B∣A)⋅P(A)​ | Please note that for a math block to be displayed correctly, it needs to be separated by an empty line, above and below. Besides, the pipe character | may conflict with markdown : it is recommended to use \\vert instead. | . Tables . Tables aren&#39;t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email – a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application. Colons can be used to align columns. | Tables | Are | Cool | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 | col 2 is | centered | $12 | zebra stripes | are neat | $1 | There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don&#39;t need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown. Markdown | Less | Pretty --- | --- | --- *Still* | `renders` | **nicely** 1 | 2 | 3 .

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover – hit once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens.

"content": "A portfolio is maybe the most important thing for a designer looking for work. I talk to a lot of early career designers who have done great work, but don&#39;t adequately show it on their portfolios. This is a list of sites that I think are great to look at for inspiration. Portfolios . | https://gyanl.com/v2 | . An older version of my website that worked as a portfolio, and got me an internship at Zomato and a job at Microsoft. | https://abhishk.me/ | . Abhishek Sharma does a fantastic job of showing his work visually. The website has case studies about his projects and experiences, and also shows off his side projects and experience with code. | https://rishivanukuru.com/ | . My friend Rishi Vanukuru is a design researcher, and his website focuses on his academic work. Not every website needs to look the same, and this is a great example of carefully picking what you want to show front and centre according to your objectives. | https://fedor.design/ | . Fedor Shkliarau has an extremely dynamic portfolio site - he uses a lot of animations and videos to show his work. | https://roman.nurik.net/projects/ | . Roman Nurik has some cool projects, and he manages to show just what they do with a couple lines of text and looping videos that are only a few seconds long. Sometimes less is more. | https://www.alexkaessner.de/ | . I particularly like the iPad Main Menu concept that Alex has on his site. | http://karoliskosas.com/ | . Kosas Karolis&#39; portfolio pieces do a great job of walking you through the design process - what worked, what didn&#39;t and what the final result was. | https://www.arunesh.co.in/ | . Arunesh Singh optimises his website for people who don&#39;t have time (really—who does?). He uses a toggle on his portfolio pieces to let the reader switch between a quick and detailed overview. | https://girapatel.co/ | . This is a really nice site that shows visual/motion design work. | Gavin Nelson | . Just the basics done really well. Blogs . These are not necessarily design portfolios, but I like how they are written and how they present ideas. | https://www.arun.is/ | . Arun Venkatesan writes longform pieces about design and technology (many about Apple products) and always has beautiful illustrations and photographs. I also love his writing style - he does a wonderful job of writing in depth about topics while keeping it crisp and easy to follow. | https://tonsky.me/ | . A blog by Nikita Prokopov, the creator of Fira Code. He writes about code and design. I love both his style of writing and the visual simplicity of the website. | https://www.gwern.net/index | . This website is dark magic. I don&#39;t know how else to describe it. | https://andymatuschak.org/ | . I find something cool each time I look at Andy Matuschak&#39;s website. He also has a really cool evergreen notes system that I hope he open sources some day. | Naval | . This is a cross between a blog and a podcast landing page. Each blog post is the transcript of a podcast clip. The theme and concept is pretty simple but it works well. | Josh W Comeau | . Josh writes about web dev and has really nice touches on his website. Audio feedback? For pressing buttons on a website?? I love it. | Daniel Miessler | . Daniel writes about knowledge and the meaning of life. It&#39;s great. Other . | https://ikeadrift.com/ | . Use the QWERTY keys on your keypad to play a sick drum beat. I love this site. | https://amandayeh.com/ | . A whimsical portfolio site that evokes a sense of tech nostalgia with bitmap fonts and Windows 98 style icons. | https://paco.sh/ | . This site looks almost confusingly minimal till you hit the command icon and realise you can find everything from there. Not sure I would recommend this approach as the only way to find content on your site, but I did find it cool. | https://www.sid.today/ + https://www.siddharthjha.com/ | . Siddharth Jha&#39;s is a UX engineer, and his websites showcases some really neat touches that tend to only happen when you are a designer who can code. Check out the cool animation on the home page, and slick hover states for links! . I also really like the idea of public-by-default sites (you can see the mess of partly written thoughts I have at https://gyanl.com/archive/) and I hope this becomes more common. It&#39;s cool to see more raw, in-progress writing on the internet. Siddharth writes about this here. | https://akshayverma.net/ | . Great typography. Akshay runs Prophecy, which also has a great website. | https://www.english-editor.com/ | . This is not a design portfolio, but the site is very well designed and the information is extremely well organised.",

"title": "Public Notes Website Concept",
"content": "WYSIWYG website . I don&#39;t like the experience of writing in one format (markdown in a text editor) and consuming in another (a website). The writing and reading experiences should be as similiar to each other as possible. Posts are public by default . I have a tendency to keep rewriting things ad nauseam, and a neat trick has been to just treat my blog as a constantly work in progress area for ideas. I update older articles whenever I feel like it, and sometimes just publish a stub that&#39;s a couple lines long so I can come back and flesh it out later. Version control . Going to edit mode allows the editor to make changes that are autosaved in the draft mode, but they don&#39;t become public till you &#39;commit&#39; them. The version history shows past commits and editor can revert to any of those versions. Dense linking . Posts should be densely linked to other posts on the website (think Wikipedia). To facilitate this, it should be trivial to insert a link to another post. Typing @ should show a dropdown of other posts and the user can start searching inline. Selecting a post inserts a link to that post. Pasting links . Links pasted on the canvas should automatically convert from a URL to the title of the HTML page. Media drag-and-drop . Dragging and dropping an image or video on the canvas uploads the image into the blog. Optionally resize any images over a pixel threshold to a max width and run lossless compression. Intelligent quotes &amp;amp; dashes . I prefer smart quotes (like ‘this’ or “this”) over dumb quotes (&#39;this&#39; or &quot;this&quot;). Most text editors designed for code will use dumb quotes and hyphen instead of em-dash (- vs —). A good writing experience should automatically adjust quotes and dashes. Markdown support . Import/Export markdown files, write using markdown syntax. As soon as a valid markdown command is recognised, it is converted into the result to avoid * and # all over the article. Dynamic themes . A toggle somewhere on the page allows dark/light mode toggles as well as a theme color. There can also be a few different font and line spacing options like the Kindle interface. HTML blocks . Useful when you want to do something unusual in terms of formatting without messing with the universal theme. - . P.S. If you are looking at this page and find this interesting, reach out to me @gyanl on Twitter and I&#39;ll share a code demo where I&#39;ve started working on this.",

"content": "I was reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, and one of the concepts the author mentions caught my attention. According to Harari, there are two main classifications of chaos. First Order Chaos . An unpredictable phenomenon that doesn’t respond to predictions. For eg. The weather is a chaotic system. It can&#39;t be predicted with total accuracy because of the huge number of variables involved. However, the weather does not change based on the predictions about it. Second Order Chaos . An unpredictable phenomenon that responds to predictions about itself. For eg. stocks and politics—if someone predicts that a certain stock will rise 20% tomorrow, then people will react to the prediction. This can cause demand and hence the price to go up today, which can make the prediction incorrect. Second order chaos is, in a sense, the opposite of a self fulfiling prophecy. By making a prediction, people will react to the prediction and make it not come true.",

"title": "Feedback",
"content": "Giving feedback . A thumb rule I use for feedback is—what can I say that would help this person get one level higher with their work? This helps scale feedback to where someone is currently at in terms of skills, thought process and ability to execute. Giving someone pointers for things that are too far beyond their current abilities is not very helpful, and may result in confusion (at best) or hostility (at worst). Receiving feedback . When you work hard and spend time on making something, you tend to fall in love with it. If you get emotionally attached to your work, it becomes really hard to hear &quot;this sucks&quot; and it becomes very easy to interpret it as &quot;you suck&quot;. There is some pride that I inevitably have about my ideas and my work, and so once in a while I&#39;ll receive some feedback that I disagree with so much that it will make me angry, where I will internally rage at how people are missing the point of what I&#39;m trying to do. It&#39;s best to try and take a beat when you hear something about your work. Do not respond immediately—even if you disagree completely with what is being said. It is often more useful to hear everyone out in the time available and set up time to follow up individually to discuss in more detail.",

"content": "Turning 26 (2022) . This year was a better year than the last one. It feels, finally, that the world is back to normal. A new normal maybe, where we wear masks all the time and laugh nervously each time someone coughs. I am glad to once again be in a world filled with people, with friends you can hug, and aquaintances you can smile at in the hallways. Highlights of the year . Getting vaccinated . Getting an appointment was a bit of a challenge in the early days of vaccine availablity, so I was quite happy when the day finally came. I think I expected it to be a huge milestone after which things would suddenly get better, but getting the actual shots felt a little bit anti climactic—life felt pretty much the same. I had a day of fever after the first shot, but the second one was pretty mild. I have avoided getting COVID so far, and I&#39;m hoping to keep it that way. My brother and I at the vaccination centre. Hooray for modern medicine. Moving out . Moved out to a tiny apartment and lived by myself for a while. I moved out and then moved back home. This is what living in my office and working in my bedroom looked like a lot of the time . I built a makeshift bookshelf with cardboard and tape . Working from Office . The Microsoft office in Noida opened up for any employees who wanted to work from there. It is a beautiful space inspired by the Taj Mahal, and I was glad to be able to meet some of my colleagues and have a nice workspace available a 15 minute walk away from my apartment. The coffee station . Outdoor seating . Visitor area . I really liked these plates that are used as wall decoration . A photo taken by a colleague . Buying better shoes . I wanted to do more running and decided to invest in a pair of Skechers. I haven&#39;t ended up doing much running, but I wear the Skechers everywhere now. They&#39;re so comfortable! . Trip to Shimla . I took a week off to travel to Shimla with my mom and brother. We stayed with my grandparents, who were also glad to have escaped Delhi after over a year of staying indoors. We decided to stay an extra week and I worked from the mountains for a while. My mother and brother on a rainy day when it felt like we were inside the clouds . We would walk down to the parking lot to catch a rectangular sliver of the senset view . My grandmother with a pumpkin flower she found . My grandfather and a mother walking up the mountain to the market close by . I spent a lot of time trying to make friends with this cat . Gauri&#39;s wedding in Pune . Went to Pune for Gauri&#39;s wedding. Met all my IDC friends for the graduation farewell we never had. I wish I could explain what was in the box . Me with my friends Prachi (left) and Apoorva (mid) . I love this awkward photo of Rohan and Dhiraj . I met Rishi after an entire year . Goa with friends . I&#39;ve travelled with friends before or to visit friends before, but that has always involved some kind of work. This was my first vacation with friends, and it was nice to be able to spend a week eating seafood, getting drunk, and watching the sunsets on the beach. I have one of these beach stock photos now . Another beach stock photo, but this time it&#39;s me with a shirt I bought at a beach shack . Audiobooks . I keep buying paper books and not reading them, but something that works well for me is listening to audiobooks. I am able to finish chores or travel while listening to a book, and I am able to absorb the content almost as well as reading. I was never one to underline passages or scribble in margins, so there is very little I miss about paper books other than the romanticised idea of reading a book. Journalling . I bought a Muji notebook on a whim and decided I needed to do something with it, and started journalling. I make it a point to write down what feel like the major things happening in my life. I enjoy the act of putting ink on paper, and if nothing else this becomes an excuse to use my fountain pen now and then. Things I want to do at 26 . | Move out of Delhi | Learn to play the keyboard | Take pottery or sculpture classes | Find more time to do things I enjoy | Read 6 paper books | Get off all social media for some time, see if it helps with focus | Be stricter about not letting work bleed into personal time | .",
